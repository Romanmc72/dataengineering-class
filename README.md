# Data Engineering Class

Hello and welcome to class! My name is Roman Czerwinski and I am here to guide you through some of the basics of Data Engineering. I have had a successful career in this field and wanted to pass along some of my learnings to those who are looking to get started. My assumptions are that you are approaching this with very little programming experience but maybe a lot of prowess in something like Excel and/or Tableau. If you do have some programming experience, then all the better! I will use Python and SQL for the majority of the exercises here. If you are looking for a Java tutorial then you are in the wrong place.

## What is here

Looking at the files in this repository, you will find fully bundled lessons with all of the things packaged to gether that you will need to complete the lesson. I may or may not also have linked some Google Slides that you can flip through as a visual aid. Follow through the different courses in this directory in numerical order and by the end hopefully you will have learned something. If you learn nothing then maybe I am not a great teacher or perhaps yuo already knew all of this.

## Disclaimers

This a representation of some of _my personal experience_ and is not a guarantee that it will translate to you or the jobs you are applying for. I do not promise to get you a job. Even if you and I had the same skill set, it would not guarantee that we would interview at the same job and both land it. One because systemic biases exist and two because interviewing in and of itself is a skill that we have different levels of experience with.

Also I use cuss words. If that offends you, you do not have to look through this stuff. Nobody is forcing you to learn this or to use my material. There are plenty of free tutorials out there so you can go find another one where they don't say "fuck". I honestly don't care.

I develop on a MacbookPro. If you use windows or linux then maybe not everything will translate. If it does not then I am sorry but I will not spend much time bending things to meet the needs of your operating system. If there are workarounds or modifications that can be made to make things work more easily on your system, then feel free to submit them as PR's containing non-breaking changes for the existing material. I might get to your PR in a timely fashion and I also might not. I have a life and this is not my full time job.

## Using this repository

- As I mentioned you should be able to proceed from top to bottom in order of the course numbers to accomplish the lessons.
- There is a 000 course that you should look at first. It is just a `README.md` like this one describing the software you need to install to move forwards.
  - Installing software is a pain in the ass, so set a side enough time to get that all done before you got too far down any one lesson.
