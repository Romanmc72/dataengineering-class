# Installing Software

This is probably the biggest pain in the ass part of developing. Whenever I install software I inevitably run into issues configuring my setup that require heading to Google and asking the internet why my computer hates me. Thankfully sites like StackOverflow exist to catalog all of the technology questions and answers taht have ever been asked. I will leave it up to those places to exhaustively list all of the problems and their solutions. In this folder I will just include what you need to install on your computer to run these tutorials.

## Need to install

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - All programs are written in Python3, find your OS from the list
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
  - This will be a way to create and run virtualized "servers" on your laptop to imitate certain real-world scenarios
  - Find your OS on the list
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - This is to download this repository and create your own if you want. I would suggest doing so in your own github account. Github is free and you can create a whole bunch of public repositories.
  - Find your OS on the list

## Optional

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as my IDE, you can use PyCharm, Atom, Notepad++ or whatever you want. That is just what I am using.
