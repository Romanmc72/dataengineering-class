# The Goal

This tutorial focuses on whether or not you are able to run the software that we have installed so far. It will also help familiarize you with the way in which these lessons will be constructed as far as from start-to-finish and validating the success of your developed programs.


## Getting Started

I am assuming that you already have the [installing software](../000-installing-software/README.md) section completed for all of the listed software from the prior page. I will no longer state that assumption. From here on out I will assume that you have completed all of the tutorials prior to the one you are looking at. Here we go!

### Folders & Scripts

For this we will run through some helpful bash commands, some helpful python basics, and some SQL basics.

Head into these folders to see what is in store there.

- bash
