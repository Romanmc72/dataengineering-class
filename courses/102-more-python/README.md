# More Python

This portion of the coures is aimed more at expanding your python skills. Some things that you could potentially do here include "building a small video game" or "buidling a web app" or "Build an API" to name a few. If there is anything in specific that interests you I suggest you go off and try to tackle that project. As for here though, I will focus on the task of launching an API.

Why?...

I believe it is a useful skill to know how API's work, why they exist, and how to interact with them. It is important to know how to work with them because you will work with them a lot in data engineering and you will sometimes even be asked to build them yourself. So let's get to it!

## Goal of this course

Build an API that stores data and spits it back out.

### Using the course here

There are several parts to this section of the course, so I will break it down into a few folders within which you can learn individual pieces. Those folders each hav etheir own `README` and like the rest of this course should be done in sequence.

### Folders

1. Packages (installing more things)
2. Endpoints (Actually doing the project)
